## About the Project

This project aims to provide a clean and intuitive interface for users to view real-time or static data related to cryptocurrencies. It's a front-end focused application demonstrating the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and data handling.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    
-   **Dynamic Content:** (If applicable, mention if it fetches live data) Displays cryptocurrency names, symbols, prices, and other relevant metrics.
    
-   **Clean UI:** Modern and user-friendly interface.
    
-   **Interactive Elements:** (e.g., clickable cards, search functionality if implemented).
    

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the web pages.
    
-   **CSS3:** For styling the website, including layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness.
    
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For dynamic content, interactivity, and (if applicable) fetching data from APIs.
